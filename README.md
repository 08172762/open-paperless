    Open Paperless is a document management system. Its main purpose is to store,
    introspect, and categorize files, with a strong emphasis on preserving the
    contextual and business information of documents. It can also OCR, preview,
    label, sign, send, and receive thoses files. Other features of interest
    are its workflow system, role based access control, and REST API.
